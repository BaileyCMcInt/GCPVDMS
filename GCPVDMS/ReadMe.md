This project is a two-semester project Senior Project Class. Four senior level students are
creating a volunteer and donor management system for the Giving Closet Project company. 
This system provides database features for volunteer and donor tracking, as well as user 
website features for volunteers to create accounts, manage their profiles and log/track their volunteer hours.
